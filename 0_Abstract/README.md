A wiper is a necessary component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid off the vehicle's windscreen. The prior system required manual wiper activation, and the operation of bringing up the wiper was difficult to manage. As a result, this system is proposed to address these issues. The project's goals are to improve ageing cars' systems by giving automated transmission.This proposed wiper system's concept is similar to that of other existing conventional wipers. According to the water condition from the outside of a car, the wiper system worked properly. This project contributed to the design of an automatic wiper system for future research in this field.
